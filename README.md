# Introduction

## Welcome to NFTHab

NFTHab is a closed NFT Marketplace and is more similar to an exclusive Art Gallery. Although everyone is able to buy and sell NFTs on our marketplace. The ability to add new NFTs and Collections is limited to artists specifically selected to bring you the freshest NFTs available.

NFTHab is part of the [DigiBirr ](https://www.dbirr.org)ecosystem on the [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation) blockchain. The ecosystem aims to provide safe, affordable and reliable systems that support African representatives and their families around the world. The _**DigiBirr**_ token acts as NFTHab's **governance token** and will also allow access to **diverse farms** for staking and other **user-centered services** that are planned and outlined on our Road Map.&#x20;
