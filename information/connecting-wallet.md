# Connecting Wallet

To use NFTHab you need a MetaMask wallet connected to the Fantom Opera network. For information on MetaMask, visit their [website](https://metamask.io).&#x20;

MetaMask by default only supports the Ethereum network. However, when you connect MetaMask to NFTHab, the site will prompt the user to allow Metamask configuration for Fantom Opera. \
\
To perform transactions on NFTHab or any other Fantom protocols, you will need FTM for gas. See here for the guide to how to get free gas from Official Fantom Faucet:&#x20;
