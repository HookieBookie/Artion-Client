# Collections

Fantom Opera is compatible with [ERC-721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721) and [ERC-1155](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155)

At the time of launch, NFTHab supports only the creation of **ERC-721** collections and we are working to implement ERC-1155.

NFTHab is an exclusive Marketplace that reserves the ability to create new NFTs and collections for selected artists.

Collections cannot be sold or bought, only the NFTs they create can be exchanged. These should not be confused with bundles of NFTs, a feature that will be added to NFTHab soon.

## Creation

Once approved, artists can create new collections for final review. Access to this page is through the wallet drop-down menu which will connect to the collection registration page.

**Existing** collections that meet the ERC smart contract standards can be registered seperately and are not created as new collections on NFTHab.

## Minting

Collection owners can mint new NFTs on the Marketplace, public collections allow other artists to also mint NFTs, allowing for collaborations between artists. (Future functionality of NFT contracts will also facilitate the sharing of royalties.)
