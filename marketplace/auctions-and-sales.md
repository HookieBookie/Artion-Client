# Auctions and Sales

NFTHab allows NFT owners to list their tokens for direct sale or auction. If an NFT a user likes is not currently listed for sale, there also exists the option to make the owner an offer. Users must set an expiration date when submitting an offer.&#x20;

Payment tokens used for the transactions are decided by the user initiating the transaction.
